# Packet Sniffer GUI

### **Description:**

Welcome to the Packet Sniffer GUI project! This Python-based application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for capturing and analyzing network packets, leveraging the Tkinter library for GUI development and Scapy for packet manipulation. This tool empowers users to customize packet capture by specifying the network interface, output file, and setting a limit on the number of captured packets.

### **GUI Elements:**

- **Interface:**
   - *Meaning:* Specify the network interface (e.g., "wlan0") to capture traffic from a specific network connection.
   - *Example:* Enter "wlan0" to monitor Wi-Fi traffic.

- **Output File:**
   - *Meaning:* Provide the path and name of the output file to store captured packet details.
   - *Example:* Enter "captured_packets.txt" to save details in a file named "captured_packets.txt" in the current directory.

- **Packet Count Limit:**
   - *Meaning:* Set the maximum number of captured packets, controlling the duration or amount of data collected.
   - *Example:* Enter "100" to capture up to 100 packets.

### **Output Display:**

- *Meaning:* The displayed output includes real-time details of each captured packet, such as source and destination IPs, ports, and packet contents. It also shows progress messages and the final status when packet capture is complete.
